## Introduction
####My name is Richelle Johnson, and I am a sophomore Honors Philosophy Major from LA. I'm excited to be taking this class as a non-STEM major because it's a good challenge and will help me analyze future research data. I've been studying tech ethics in preparation for my thesis, so it's been interesting to see how it's being implemented in the collection and sharing of data. I'd like to learn how to present data more clearly and concisely using the functions provided in the Jupyter Notebook.
